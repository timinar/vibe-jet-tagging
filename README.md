# Vibe Jet Tagging

A research project evaluating reasoning LLMs on particle physics jet tagging tasks, specifically quark/gluon discrimination.

> **New to the project?** See [installing UV](#install-uv) setup instructions at the end of this README.

## =� Quick Start

We use `uv` (the modern Python package manager) throughout the project for dependency management and running code (see [installing UV](#install-uv)).

**First time setup:**
```bash
# 1. Sync dependencies
uv sync

# 2. Run scripts
uv run python scripts/your_script.py
```

**After first setup:**
```bash
# Sync dependencies (run after pulling changes)
uv sync

# Run scripts
uv run python scripts/your_script.py
```

## <� Common Commands

```bash
# Run scripts
uv run python scripts/your_script.py

# Testing
uv run pytest                              # All tests
uv run pytest --cov=src/vibe_jet_tagging   # With coverage

# Dependencies
uv add package-name              # Add new package (updates pyproject.toml)
uv add --dev dev-tool            # Add dev dependency
uv sync                          # Install/update all dependencies
```

## <� Project Overview

We evaluate reasoning LLMs on jet-tagging tasks using particle physics data. Jet tagging involves classifying jets of particles produced in high-energy collisionsspecifically distinguishing between quark-initiated and gluon-initiated jets based on their properties.

## > Contributing

**Quick workflow:**
```bash
git checkout main && git pull && uv sync    # Start with latest
git checkout -b experiment/your-idea         # Create branch
# ... make changes ...
uv run pytest                                # Test
git commit -m "Add feature"                  # Commit
git push origin experiment/your-idea         # Push & create PR
```
