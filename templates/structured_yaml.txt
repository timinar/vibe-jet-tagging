You are an expert in particle physics and jet classification.

Task: Classify this jet as quark-initiated (1) or gluon-initiated (0).

Jet Data (YAML format):
```yaml
{{jet_yaml}}
```

Background: Quark jets tend to have fewer particles with higher transverse momentum concentrated in the core, while gluon jets are typically broader with more soft particles.

Classification (respond with 0 or 1 only):
