You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

A jet consists of particles, each with the following properties:
- pt: transverse momentum (GeV)
- y: rapidity
- phi: azimuthal angle (radians)
- pid: particle ID

Here is the jet data:
{{jet_particles}}

Based on the particle content and kinematics, what is the probability that this jet is a quark jet?

Respond with ONLY a single number between 0 and 1, where:
- 0.0 means definitely a gluon jet
- 1.0 means definitely a quark jet
- Values in between represent your confidence (e.g., 0.7 means 70% confident it's a quark jet)

Respond with ONLY the probability value, nothing else.
