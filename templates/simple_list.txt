You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

A jet consists of particles, each with the following properties:
- pt: transverse momentum (GeV)
- y: rapidity
- phi: azimuthal angle (radians)
- pid: particle ID

Here is the jet data:
{{jet_particles}}

Based on the particle content and kinematics, is this a quark jet (1) or gluon jet (0)?

Respond with ONLY the number 0 or 1, nothing else.
