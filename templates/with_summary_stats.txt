You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

A jet consists of particles, each with the following properties:
- pt: transverse momentum (GeV)
- y: rapidity
- phi: azimuthal angle (radians)
- pid: particle ID

**Key Physics Insight:**
Based on quantum chromodynamics (QCD), gluons and quarks have different radiation patterns:

- Quark jets typically have: ~33 particles per jet (mean: 33.4 ± 13.3)
- Gluon jets typically have: ~53 particles per jet (mean: 53.2 ± 15.8)
- Gluon/Quark ratio: 1.59 (gluons have ~59% more particles)

This multiplicity difference is the primary discriminating feature. Gluon jets radiate more particles due to their stronger QCD color charge (CA/CF = 2.25).

Additional patterns:
- Quark jet particles have higher average pt: 15.7 ± 32.6 GeV
- Gluon jet particles have lower average pt: 9.8 ± 17.8 GeV
- Both jet types have similar rapidity and azimuthal angle distributions

Based on the particle content and kinematics, what is the probability that this jet is a quark jet?

Respond with ONLY a single number between 0 and 1, where:
- 0.0 means definitely a gluon jet
- 1.0 means definitely a quark jet
- Values in between represent your confidence (e.g., 0.7 means 70% confident it's a quark jet)

Respond with ONLY the probability value, nothing else.
