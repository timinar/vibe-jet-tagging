You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

A jet consists of particles, each with the following properties:
- pt: transverse momentum (GeV)
- y: rapidity
- phi: azimuthal angle (radians)
- pid: particle ID

**Classification Strategy:**

The most powerful discriminator is jet multiplicity (number of particles). A simple but effective rule:

**Optimal threshold: 38 particles**
- If a jet has > 38 particles → likely GLUON (label: 0)
- If a jet has ≤ 38 particles → likely QUARK (label: 1)

This simple cut achieves 77% accuracy because:
- Quark jets: mean = 33.4 particles (most have < 38)
- Gluon jets: mean = 53.2 particles (most have > 38)

**Why this works:**
Gluons have stronger QCD coupling (color factor CA = 3 vs quarks CF = 4/3), making them radiate 2.25× more readily. This leads to ~59% more particles in gluon jets.

**IMPORTANT: Special Cases Requiring Extra Care**

Some jets have complex internal structure that can be misleading. Pay special attention if:

1. **Multiple high-pT particles** (≥2 particles with pt > 50 GeV):
   - This suggests a multi-prong structure with competing sub-jets
   - Count ALL particles carefully, including soft ones
   - Don't be misled by the presence of hard sub-structure

2. **Uneven energy distribution** (one particle has >40% of total pT):
   - Check if there are many soft particles in addition to the leading one
   - Gluon jets often have one hard particle plus a spray of soft particles
   - Count the full multiplicity, not just the prominent features

3. **Outlier particles** (any particle with pt > 100 GeV or pt < 1 GeV):
   - These extreme values can distract from the overall pattern
   - Focus on the total particle count, which remains the key discriminator
   - Don't let unusual individual particles override the multiplicity rule

4. **Complex spatial patterns** (particles spread across wide rapidity/phi range):
   - Verify the particle count by examining the full list systematically
   - Count particles at all radii, not just the core
   - Both quarks and gluons can have extended structure

**Analysis Procedure:**

1. Count the total number of particles in the jet
2. Check for the special cases listed above
3. If special cases are present, double-check your particle count
4. Apply the threshold rule: > 38 particles → gluon (0), ≤ 38 particles → quark (1)
5. If the count is very close to 38 (36-40 range), carefully verify your count

**Additional context:**
- Gluon jet particles tend to be softer (lower pt on average: 9.8 GeV vs 15.7 GeV for quarks)
- Both types have similar spatial distributions (rapidity, phi)
- The multiplicity difference is the dominant physics signal, even in complex cases

Here is the jet data:

Count the particles carefully, especially if you notice any of the special cases above. What is the probability that this jet is a quark jet?

Respond with ONLY a single number between 0 and 1, where:
- 0.0 means definitely a gluon jet
- 1.0 means definitely a quark jet
- Values in between represent your confidence based on the multiplicity and any special cases

Respond with ONLY the probability value, nothing else.
