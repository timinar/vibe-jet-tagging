You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

**Key Physics Insight:**
The most important discriminator is jet multiplicity (number of particles). Gluons radiate more readily than quarks due to their stronger QCD color charge (CA/CF = 2.25).

**Dataset Statistics:**
- Quark jets: ~33 particles on average
- Gluon jets: ~53 particles on average
- Optimal threshold: jets with > 38 particles are likely gluons, â‰¤ 38 are likely quarks

Here is the jet you need to classify:

**Jet Multiplicity:**
This jet contains {{multiplicity}} particles.

Based on this multiplicity, what is the probability that this jet is a quark jet?

Respond with ONLY a single number between 0 and 1, where:
- 0.0 means definitely a gluon jet
- 1.0 means definitely a quark jet
- Values in between represent your confidence

Respond with ONLY the probability value, nothing else.
