You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

**Key Physics Insight:**
The most important discriminator is jet multiplicity (number of particles). Gluons radiate more readily than quarks due to their stronger QCD color charge (CA/CF = 2.25).

**Dataset Statistics:**
- Quark jets: ~33 particles on average
- Gluon jets: ~53 particles on average
- Optimal threshold: jets with > 38 particles are likely gluons, â‰¤ 38 are likely quarks

Here is the jet you need to classify:

**Jet Multiplicity:**
This jet contains {{multiplicity}} particles.

Based on this multiplicity, is this a quark jet (1) or gluon jet (0)?

Respond with ONLY the number 0 or 1, nothing else.
