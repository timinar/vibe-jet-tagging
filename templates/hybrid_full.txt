You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

**Engineered Features Summary:**
{{jet_features}}

**Feature Interpretation:**
1. **Multiplicity** - Most important: Quark ~33, Gluon ~53 (threshold: 38)
2. **Mean pT** - Quark: higher (~15.7 GeV), Gluon: lower (~9.8 GeV)
3. **pT Concentration** - Quark: more concentrated, Gluon: more diffuse
4. **pT Spread** - Indicates energy distribution

**Decision Strategy:**
1. Start with multiplicity (gives ~77% accuracy alone)
2. Refine with mean pT
3. Check pT concentration for confirmation
4. Examine raw particles for edge cases

**Raw Particle Data:**
Here are all the individual particles in this jet for detailed analysis:

**Instructions:**
Use the high-level features as your primary guide, but refer to the raw particle data to:
- Verify the features make sense
- Check for unusual patterns
- Make final decision on edge cases

Based on the engineered features and raw particle data, what is the probability that this jet is a quark jet?

Respond with ONLY a single number between 0 and 1, where:
- 0.0 means definitely a gluon jet
- 1.0 means definitely a quark jet
- Values in between represent your confidence based on all available information

Respond with ONLY the probability value, nothing else.
