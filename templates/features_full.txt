You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

**Physics Background:**
Quark and gluon jets differ due to QCD color factors (CA/CF = 2.25). This manifests in multiple observable features.

**Feature Interpretation Guide:**

1. **Multiplicity** (most important)
   - Quark: 33.4 ± 13.3 particles
   - Gluon: 53.2 ± 15.8 particles
   - Threshold: > 38 particles → gluon

2. **Mean pT** (second most important)
   - Quark: higher (~15.7 GeV) - harder fragmentation
   - Gluon: lower (~9.8 GeV) - softer fragmentation

3. **pT Concentration** (leading/top-N fractions)
   - Quark: more concentrated energy (fewer hard particles)
   - Gluon: more diffuse energy (many soft particles)
   - Higher leading pT fraction → quark
   - Lower leading pT fraction → gluon

4. **pT Spread (std dev)**
   - Indicates how widely distributed the energy is
   - Combine with mean pT for full picture

Here is the jet you need to classify:

{{jet_features}}

**Decision Strategy:**
1. Start with multiplicity - this alone gives ~77% accuracy
2. Refine with mean pT - distinguishes edge cases
3. Use pT concentration for final confidence
4. Combine all features for best performance

**Expected Performance:**
- Using multiplicity alone: ~84% AUC
- Using all features: ~85% AUC

Based on all these engineered features, what is the probability that this jet is a quark jet?

Respond with ONLY a single number between 0 and 1, where:
- 0.0 means definitely a gluon jet
- 1.0 means definitely a quark jet
- Values in between represent your confidence based on the combined features

Respond with ONLY the probability value, nothing else.
