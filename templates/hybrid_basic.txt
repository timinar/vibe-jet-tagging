You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

**Summary Features:**
This jet contains {{multiplicity}} particles.

**Key Physics Insight:**
- Quark jets: ~33 particles on average
- Gluon jets: ~53 particles on average
- Optimal threshold: > 38 particles â†’ gluon

**Raw Particle Data:**
{{jet_particles}}

Based on the multiplicity feature and the raw particle data, is this a quark jet (1) or gluon jet (0)?

Respond with ONLY the number 0 or 1, nothing else.
