You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

**Summary Features:**
This jet contains {{multiplicity}} particles.

**Key Physics Insight:**
- Quark jets: ~33 particles on average
- Gluon jets: ~53 particles on average
- Optimal threshold: > 38 particles â†’ gluon

**Raw Particle Data:**
{{jet_particles}}

Based on the multiplicity feature and the raw particle data, what is the probability that this jet is a quark jet?

Respond with ONLY a single number between 0 and 1, where:
- 0.0 means definitely a gluon jet
- 1.0 means definitely a quark jet
- Values in between represent your confidence

Respond with ONLY the probability value, nothing else.
