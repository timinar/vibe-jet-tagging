You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

A jet consists of particles, each with the following properties:
- pt: transverse momentum (GeV)
- y: rapidity
- phi: azimuthal angle (radians)
- pid: particle ID

**Advanced Classification Strategy:**

Expert physicists use multiple hand-engineered features for classification. Here are the most discriminating ones:

**1. MULTIPLICITY (Most Important)**
   - Count particles in the jet
   - Threshold: > 38 particles → GLUON, ≤ 38 → QUARK
   - Quark: 33.4 ± 13.3 particles | Gluon: 53.2 ± 15.8 particles

**2. MEAN PT (Second Most Important)**
   - Calculate average pt across all particles
   - Quark jets: higher mean pt (~15.7 GeV)
   - Gluon jets: lower mean pt (~9.8 GeV)
   - Higher mean pt suggests QUARK

**3. PT CONCENTRATION**
   - Leading particle fraction: (highest pt) / (total pt)
   - Top-3 pt fraction: (sum of top 3 pt) / (total pt)
   - Quark jets tend to be more concentrated (fewer but harder particles)
   - Gluon jets are more diffuse (many soft particles)

**4. PT DISPERSION**
   - Standard deviation of pt values
   - Median pt value
   - Quark jets show higher pt variance
   - Max pt can be informative but is less reliable

**Feature Importance Ranking (from machine learning analysis):**
   1. mean_pt (coefficient: 1.03) - Most discriminating
   2. multiplicity (coefficient: 0.41) - Strong signal
   3. top3_pt_frac (coefficient: 0.26)
   4. lead_pt_frac (coefficient: 0.24)
   5. median_pt (coefficient: 0.23)

**Physics Intuition:**
- Gluons radiate more → higher multiplicity, lower mean pt
- Quarks fragment harder → lower multiplicity, higher mean pt, more concentrated energy

**Classification Approach:**
1. Count particles (multiplicity)
2. Calculate mean pt
3. Consider pt concentration
4. Combine features: High multiplicity + Low mean pt → GLUON
5. Low multiplicity + High mean pt → QUARK

Here is the jet data:

Analyze the jet using the engineered features above. Is this a quark jet (1) or gluon jet (0)?

Respond with ONLY the number 0 or 1, nothing else.
