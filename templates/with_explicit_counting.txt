You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

A jet consists of particles, each with the following properties:
- pt: transverse momentum (GeV)
- y: rapidity
- phi: azimuthal angle (radians)
- pid: particle ID

**Classification Strategy:**

The ONLY thing that matters is **counting particles accurately**.

**Rule:**
- Count the NUMBER of particles (rows in the data)
- If count > 38 → GLUON (label: 0)
- If count ≤ 38 → QUARK (label: 1)

**Why this works:**
Gluon jets have more particles (mean: 53.2) than quark jets (mean: 33.4) due to stronger QCD radiation.

**CRITICAL: Accurate Counting**

Jets can have complex structure that makes counting difficult:
- Some jets have 100+ particles - count each row
- Some particles have very high or very low pt - count them all
- Some particles are spread across wide angles - count them all
- Some jets have multiple high-energy particles - count them all
- IGNORE the pt, y, phi, pid values - just count rows

**Step-by-step procedure:**

1. Look at the jet data below
2. Count EVERY row (each row = one particle)
3. Write down the count
4. Apply rule: > 38 → gluon (0), ≤ 38 → quark (1)

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Don't estimate - count every single particle
- Don't skip particles with unusual properties
- Don't be distracted by high-pt particles
- The answer is determined ONLY by the count

Here is the jet data:
{{jet_particles}}

Count the total number of particles (rows) in the data above. Then estimate the probability.

Respond with ONLY a single number between 0 and 1, where:
- 0.0 means definitely a gluon jet
- 1.0 means definitely a quark jet
- Values in between represent your confidence based on how far the multiplicity is from the threshold

Respond with ONLY the probability value, nothing else.
