You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

**High-Level Features:**
{{jet_features}}

**Typical Patterns:**
- Quark jets: ~33 particles, mean pT ~15.7 GeV
- Gluon jets: ~53 particles, mean pT ~9.8 GeV

**Classification Guidelines:**
- High multiplicity (> 38) + Low mean pT (< 12 GeV) → Strong gluon signal
- Low multiplicity (≤ 38) + High mean pT (> 12 GeV) → Strong quark signal

**Raw Particle Data:**
Below are the individual particles in this jet:

{{jet_particles}}

Based on both the extracted features and the raw particle data, what is the probability that this jet is a quark jet?

Respond with ONLY a single number between 0 and 1, where:
- 0.0 means definitely a gluon jet
- 1.0 means definitely a quark jet
- Values in between represent your confidence based on all available information

Respond with ONLY the probability value, nothing else.
