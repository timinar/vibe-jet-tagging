You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

**High-Level Features:**
{{jet_features}}

**Typical Patterns:**
- Quark jets: ~33 particles, mean pT ~15.7 GeV
- Gluon jets: ~53 particles, mean pT ~9.8 GeV

**Classification Guidelines:**
- High multiplicity (> 38) + Low mean pT (< 12 GeV) → Strong gluon signal
- Low multiplicity (≤ 38) + High mean pT (> 12 GeV) → Strong quark signal

**Raw Particle Data:**
Below are the individual particles in this jet:

{{jet_particles}}

Based on both the extracted features and the raw particle data, is this a quark jet (1) or gluon jet (0)?

Respond with ONLY the number 0 or 1, nothing else.
