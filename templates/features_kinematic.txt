You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

**Key Physics Insights:**
Gluons and quarks have different radiation patterns due to QCD color factors:
1. **Higher multiplicity** → Gluon (more particles radiated)
2. **Lower mean pT** → Gluon (softer fragmentation)
3. **Higher mean pT** → Quark (harder fragmentation)

**Typical Patterns:**
- Quark jets: ~33 particles, mean pT ~15.7 GeV
- Gluon jets: ~53 particles, mean pT ~9.8 GeV

Here is the jet you need to classify:

**Classification Guidelines:**
- High multiplicity (> 38) + Low mean pT (< 12 GeV) → Strong gluon signal
- Low multiplicity (≤ 38) + High mean pT (> 12 GeV) → Strong quark signal
- Consider both features together for best accuracy

Based on these kinematic features, is this a quark jet (1) or gluon jet (0)?

Respond with ONLY the number 0 or 1, nothing else.
