You are a particle physics expert. Your task is to classify whether a jet is initiated by a quark (label: 1) or a gluon (label: 0).

A jet consists of particles, each with the following properties:
- pt: transverse momentum (GeV)
- y: rapidity
- phi: azimuthal angle (radians)
- pid: particle ID

**Classification Strategy:**

The most powerful discriminator is jet multiplicity (number of particles). A simple but effective rule:

**Optimal threshold: 38 particles**
- If a jet has > 38 particles → likely GLUON (label: 0)
- If a jet has ≤ 38 particles → likely QUARK (label: 1)

This simple cut achieves 77% accuracy because:
- Quark jets: mean = 33.4 particles (most have < 38)
- Gluon jets: mean = 53.2 particles (most have > 38)

**Why this works:**
Gluons have stronger QCD coupling (color factor CA = 3 vs quarks CF = 4/3), making them radiate 2.25× more readily. This leads to ~59% more particles in gluon jets.

**Additional context:**
- Gluon jet particles tend to be softer (lower pt on average: 9.8 GeV vs 15.7 GeV for quarks)
- Both types have similar spatial distributions (rapidity, phi)
- The multiplicity difference is the dominant physics signal

Here is the jet data:

Count the particles and consider the threshold rule. What is the probability that this jet is a quark jet?

Respond with ONLY a single number between 0 and 1, where:
- 0.0 means definitely a gluon jet
- 1.0 means definitely a quark jet
- Values in between represent your confidence (e.g., 0.7 means 70% confident it's a quark jet)

Consider how far the multiplicity is from the threshold when determining your confidence.

Respond with ONLY the probability value, nothing else.
